# Data Visualization Dashboard

This project is a simple data visualization dashboard built using HTML and CSS. It provides a basic interface for displaying charts and filtering data.

## Functionality

The dashboard currently displays two types of charts:

* **Bar Chart:** A static bar chart representing sample data.  Each bar is color-coded and displays a label.
* **Area Chart:**  A static area chart, also with sample data, and labels for data points.

Users can interact with the dashboard using the following filters:

* **Age:** A dropdown menu to filter data by age groups.
* **Gender:** A dropdown menu to filter data by gender.
* **Date:** A date picker to filter data by a specific date.

The dashboard also includes a navigation bar with links to "Home," "Report," and "Profile." The "Profile" link leads to a login page (login.html), which further links to a signup page (signup.html).  These pages currently contain placeholder forms for user authentication.

## HTML Features Used

* **Semantic HTML:**  `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<footer>` tags are used for structuring the content.
* **Forms and Inputs:** `<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<button>`, `<select>` elements are used for user input and filtering.
* **Data Attributes:**  (Not currently used but could be implemented to enhance interactivity.)
* **SVG:** Used for creating the area chart within the `<svg>` tag.

## CSS Features Used

* **Flexbox:** Used extensively for layout, particularly in the header, navigation, filters, and charts sections.
* **Grid:** (Not currently used but could be an alternative for layout in some areas.)
* **Responsive Design:** Media queries are used to adapt the layout for different screen sizes, ensuring usability on mobile devices and tablets.
* **Styling:** CSS is used to style the appearance of elements, including colors, fonts, spacing, and borders.  The bar chart colors are individually styled.
* **Positioning:**  Used within the bar chart to place the bar labels.
* **Fixed Positioning:** Used for the header to keep it at the top of the page during scrolling.


## Future Improvements

* **Dynamic Charts:** Implement JavaScript to dynamically generate charts based on data and filter selections.
* **Data Handling:** Integrate a data source (e.g., CSV, JSON, API) to populate the charts with real data.
* **Interactive Charts:** Add interactivity to the charts, such as tooltips or click events.
* **Form Functionality:** Add functionality to the login and signup forms using JavaScript and potentially backend integration.
* **Accessibility:** Enhance accessibility features for users with disabilities.

## How to Run

1. Simply open `index.html` in your web browser.

This will display the dashboard with the basic HTML and CSS structure.  Since there is no JavaScript or backend integration at this stage, the filters and forms are not yet functional.
